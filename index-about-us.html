          <h2>HISTORY OF JOJO PIZZA</h2>
          <p>
            1960s–2010s In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, took over
            the operation of DomiNick's, an existing location of a small
            <b>pizza restaurant</b> chain that had been owned by Dominick
            DeVarti, at 507 Cross Street (now 301 West Cross Street) in
            Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, then the brothers
            borrowed $900 to pay for the store. The brothers planned to split
            the work hours evenly, but James did not want to quit his job as a
            full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business.
            Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom
            for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries. By 1965,
            Tom Monaghan had purchased additional pizzeria; he now had a total
            of two locations in the same county.

          <h2>ABOUT JOJO PIZZA</h2>
          <p>
            In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, JOJO began
            trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker
            symbol "DPZ". Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named
            Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011. In a
            simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its
            5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th
            international store in Panama City, Panama, making 8,000 total
            stores for the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August 2006, the JOJO location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland,
            became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3
            million (€2.35 million) per year. As of September 2006, JOJO has
            8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.
